# Set reminder with google calendar instructions

To implement the Google Calendar integration for setting reminders while maintaining the existing structure and style, we'll modify the HTML file and add some JavaScript code. Here's how we can do that:

This modification:

1. Adds the Google API script to the head of the document.
2. Modifies the `displayScholarships` function to include a "Set Reminder" button for each scholarship.
3. Implements Google Calendar API integration functions: `handleClientLoad`, `initClient`, `updateSigninStatus`, and `setReminder`.
4. Calls `handleClientLoad()` at the end of the script to initialize the Google Calendar API.


To use this code:

1. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' and 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID' with your actual Google Calendar API key and client ID.
2. Make sure to enable the Google Calendar API in your Google Developers Console project.
3. Host these files on a web server with HTTPS, as required by the Google Calendar API.


This implementation maintains the existing style, structure, and Ultra Ade Tech details while adding the Google Calendar integration for setting reminders. Users can now click the "Set Reminder" button for each scholarship to add a reminder to their Google Calendar.
